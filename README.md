### Introduction
The BeeHiveSim project aims to reconstruct and expand upon the beehive construction algorithm and simulations of Guy Theraulaz and Eric Bonabeau in their research paper "Modelling the Collective Building of Complex Architectures in Social Insects with Lattice Swarms".

### Tools
This project leverages C# to implement the algorithm, and the Unity3D engine to visualize the results of the simulation.
